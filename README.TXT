ANSWERS TO THE QUESTIONS

2. Having added the exact amount of the price of the ticket to the balance, once a ticket is bought, the balance goes back to 0.

3. If not enough money is inserted, in the terminal window, we will be giving the command "You must insert at least X more cents." You do not recieve refunds. Inserting too much money can give an error saying
"integer number is too large".

5. The new printed ticket's only difference is that it marks the new ticket price instead of the old one (in my case it says 55 cents rather than 100 cents)


6. Outer wrappers of Student and LabClass classes could look something like this:

public class Student {
    
}

public class LabClass {

7. Whether we write public class or class public changes a lot. class public is not even valid and does not let me compile the class. Trying to compile will not give an error message but will just send you to the
editor and underlines the wrong part of the code in red, which clearly shows where the problem is.

8. It is possible to compile and continue without the word public.

9. It is not possible to compile and continue without the word class.
